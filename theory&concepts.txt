 ROS installation 
     - ubuntu is ideal

Workspaces have 3 folders: build, devel and src (src being where all packages are created and are present).
catkin installer will normally come with ros

mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws
catkin_make 
source devel/setup.bash  (this will not work for each terminal by default, so we need to put this in the bashrc file)
    this can be done by using echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

 How to set up a package in ROS    
     create a workspace where we are going to store our projects
     mkdir -p tutorials/src
     cd tutorials/
     catkin_make
         this will make devel and build: these are tools that will help us
     you shuld now have src, devel and build
     cd src
     creating a package
         every ROS package = smallest buildstone of a project
         every ROS package = molecule, every atam in that molecule is that package
         ROS package can contain configuration files, libraries, data sets and etc. or nodes etc.
         catkin_create_pkg Name_of_your_package rospy std_msgs
            example = catkin_create_pkg tutorials rospy std_msgs or roscpp
