# ROS service
    # ROS service is a thing that calculates something for us, and returns something
    # in response

# create a new folder called srv 
    # and inside this you create a file called multiplier.srv
        # in this, you define your input that will be sent to the robot, and the output that will be given by the robot


from unittest import result


int32 a
int32 b
--- # this dash separates the input from the output

int32 result

# next, create a new script and we can call it service
