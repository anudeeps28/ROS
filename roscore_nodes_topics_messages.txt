#roscore
    # collection of nodes and programs having the strucure of ros
    # command for starting it
    # has all the information of nodes, their connection, ip addresses
    # it also knows who publishes and subscribes to who, and which topics are available 
    # roscore always needs to run when we start a new project
    # you can only have one roscore runing at a time

# nodes
    # a single executable file which performs a task (like publishing data from a sensor
    # building a map of incoming data or finding a shortest distance from points)
    # It is the nodes in which we will be writing most of our code
    # It needs to collect data from another node, and send out data to another node
        # this can be done through service and topics

# topics
    # used to communicate between ROS nodes ( a ROS node can either 
    # subscribe or publish to a topic)
    # A topic can only have 1 publisher, but it can have many or infinite subscribers.   
    # it is a one-way communication
    # publisher sends information to the topic, whiile subscriber recieves information from the topic
    # there can be many subscribers
    # since it is a one way communication, if a subscriber wants to talk to the publisher, there
    # needs to be a new topic via which subscriber publishes talks to publisher subscribes to that

# messages
    # describes what content is published at a specific topic
    # example: a node whith publishes precision might publish a x,y,z inside the message to the topic
    # while a mapping node publishes a map inside the publish
    # we use map to describe a message inside the topic
