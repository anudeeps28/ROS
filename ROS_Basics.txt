# ROS - Robotics Operating System
# Open Source Framework, good community, has tools, libraries and more
# a lot of downloadable libraries are also presnet
# if you want to focus on Commputer Vision, you can download for movement and start using it while you develop your Computer Vision library.
# if you need something and don't want todevelop it yourself, search for it. It might already exist for ROS
# ROS - framework, not a programming language. Languages used with it - python and C++
# when you face errors, try to search the internet before 

# ROS installation 
    # - ubuntu is ideal

Workspaces have 3 folders: build, devel and src (src being where all packages are created and are present).
catkin installer will normally come with ros

mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws
catkin_make 
source devel/setup.bash  (this will not work for each terminal by default, so we need to put this in the bashrc file)
    this can be done by using echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

# How to set up a project in ROS    
    # create a workspace where we are going to store our projects
    # mkdir -p tutorials/src
    # cd tutorials/
    # catkin_make
        # this will make devel and build: these are tools that will help us
    # you shuld now have src, devel and build
    # cd src
    # creating a package
        # every ROS package = smallest buildstone of a project
        # every ROS package = molecule, every atam in that molecule is that package
        # ROS package can contain configuration files, libraries, data sets and etc. or nodes etc.
        # catkin_create_pkg Name_of_your_package rospy std_msgs
            example = catkin_create_pkg tutorials rospy std_msgs or roscpp 
        # cd Name_of_your_package
            # you will have CMakeLists (directives and instructions of source files) and package.xml (it contains some metadata for our package)
        # open package.xml in nvim or other editor
        CMakeLists, Package.xml and src will be created
            out code will be inside src
            CMakeLists = how to compile other package
            Package.xml = contains information about the package

    After writing all the files in src, you can compile the package by catkin_make in catkin_ws
