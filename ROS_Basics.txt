# ROS - Robotics Operating System
# Open Source Framework, good community, has tools, libraries and more
# a lot of downloadable libraries are also presnet
# if you want to focus on Commputer Vision, you can download for movement and start using it while you develop your Computer Vision library.
# if you need something and don't want todevelop it yourself, search for it. It might already exist for ROS
# ROS - framework, not a programming language. Languages used with it - python and C++
# when you face errors, try to search the internet before 

# ROS installation 
    # - ubuntu is ideal

# How to set up a project in ROS    
    # create a workspace where we are going to store our projects
    # mkdir -p tutorials/src
    # cd tutorials/
    # catkin_make
        # this will make devel and build: these are tools that will help us
    # you shuld now have src, devel and build
    # cd src
    # creating a package
        # every ROS project = smallest buildstone of a project
        # every ROS project = molecule, every atam in that molecule is that package
        # ROS package can contain configuration files, libraries, data sets and etc. or nodes etc.
        # catkin_create_pkg Name_of_your_package rospy std_msgs
        # cd Name_of_your_package
            # you will have CMakeLists (directives and instructions of source files) and package.xml (it contains some metadata for our package)
        # open package.xml in nvim or other editor
